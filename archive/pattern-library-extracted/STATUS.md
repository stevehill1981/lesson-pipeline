## Library Complete! 🎉

**Status**: ✅ 100% of planned BASIC V2 patterns complete

All patterns have been extracted, documented, and validated:
- ✅ 33 patterns covering all aspects of C64 BASIC game development
- ✅ ~15,000 lines of documentation and code examples
- ✅ 200+ code variations across all patterns
- ✅ Complete coverage from beginner to advanced techniques

**Deferred patterns** (6 patterns requiring assembly):
- Scrolling (smooth/coarse/parallax) - Hardware VIC-II control beyond BASIC
- Screen manipulation - Advanced VIC-II registers beyond BASIC capabilities

---

## Usage Recommendation
