- **Final Status:** PASS
- **Errors Found:**
  - Block 12, Line 8: `Unknown command: ...` (ellipsis)
  - Block 13, Line 2: `Unknown command: ...` (ellipsis)
  - Block 13, Line 3: `Unknown command: RULEDMG` (pseudocode)
  - Block 13, Line 4: `Unknown command: DIALOG$` (standalone variable)
  - Block 13, Line 5: `Unknown command: MUSIC$` (standalone variable)
- **Root Cause:** DATA section and Quick Reference contained placeholders/pseudocode
- **Fix:**
  - Replaced `...map rows...` with actual DATA statement
  - Replaced `...enemy pairs...` with actual DATA statement
  - Removed `... similar ...` line
  - Converted pseudocode to executable BASIC
  - Changed `STATE=1/2/3` to `STATE=1` with comment
  - Changed `ON STATE GOTO ...` to `ON STATE GOTO 1000,2000,3000`
  - Changed standalone variables to actual usage: `PRINT DIALOG$(I)`, `CUE$=MUSIC$(ROOM)`

## Pattern Analysis

**Week 3 introduces:**
- Player movement and position tracking
- Collision detection between objects
- Score display and HUD elements
- Lives/health management
- ON...GOTO/GOSUB multi-way branching
- GOSUB/RETURN subroutine organization
- Sprite basics with POKE
- Data-driven game design (maps, rules, dialogue)

**Common Pattern:**
Quick Reference sections often contain pseudocode for conceptual clarity, but code blocks should only contain executable BASIC V2.

## Issues Fixed

### Type 1: Ellipsis Placeholders
**Problem:** Using `...` to indicate omitted code
**Example:** `9010 DATA ...map rows...`
**Fix:** Replace with actual DATA or remove line
**Why:** `...` is not a valid BASIC command

### Type 2: Pseudocode in Quick Reference
**Problem:** Showing concepts without executable syntax
**Example:** `RULEDMG(ROOM)` standalone
**Fix:** Show actual usage: `DMG=RULEDMG(ROOM)`
**Why:** Helps learners see how to actually use the pattern

### Type 3: Placeholder Labels
**Problem:** Using descriptive names instead of line numbers
**Example:** `RESTORE label`
**Fix:** `RESTORE 9000`
**Why:** C64 BASIC V2 uses line numbers, not labels

## Validation Success Rate

- **Week 3 Initial:** 75% (6/8 lessons pass)
- **Week 3 Final:** 100% (8/8 lessons pass)
- **Code Blocks:** 100% (46/46 blocks valid)

## Cumulative Progress

- **Weeks 1-3 Combined:** 24 lessons
- **Total Code Blocks:** 95
- **Pass Rate:** 100%
- **Lessons Fixed:** 3 (lessons 08, 21, 24)

## Lessons Learned

### Quick Reference Sections Need Careful Review
Quick Reference sections are meant to summarize key patterns, but they often sacrifice syntactic correctness for conceptual clarity.

**Best Practice:**
- ✅ Show actual executable BASIC syntax
- ✅ Use real line numbers, not labels
- ✅ Include assignments/usage, not standalone expressions
- ❌ Don't use ellipsis or placeholders
- ❌ Don't use pseudocode that looks like code

### Mini-Games Are Most Prone to Errors
Lessons 08, 16, and 24 (the mini-games ending each week) had the most issues:
- More complex code blocks
- More Quick Reference pseudocode
- More DATA placeholders

**Action:** Pay extra attention to mini-game lessons in remaining weeks.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Week 1 complete (100%)
2. ✅ Week 2 complete (100%)
3. ✅ Week 3 complete (100%)
4. **Validate Week 4** - Lessons 25-32 (Sounds and Sensations)
5. **Pattern extraction** - Begin building pattern library from validated code
6. **Mid-course review** - After Week 4, assess progress and patterns

## Technical Notes

**All C64 BASIC V2 Commands Used in Week 3:**
- PRINT, POKE, PEEK
- FOR, NEXT
- IF, THEN
- GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN
- ON (multi-way branching)
- READ, DATA, RESTORE
- GET (keyboard input)
- REM
- Variables and arrays

**No new commands added to reference database this week.**

## Code Quality Observations

**Positive:**
- Player movement logic is clean
- Collision detection properly structured
- GOSUB/RETURN organization is good
- Data-driven design patterns emerging
- Sprite POKE sequences correct

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Quick Reference sections need to balance clarity with correctness
- DATA examples should show complete patterns, not placeholders
- Comments should clarify intent without using pseudocode syntax

---

**Overall:** Week 3 validates successfully after fixing Quick Reference pseudocode and DATA placeholders. The actual game logic is solid and demonstrates progressive complexity appropriate for the course stage.
