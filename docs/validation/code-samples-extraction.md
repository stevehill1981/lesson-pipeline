## File Structure

### Multiple Code Blocks (most lessons)
When a lesson contains multiple code examples, they are numbered:
```
week-N/lesson-NN/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-1.bas    # First code block (usually "Basic Example")
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-2.bas    # Second code block (usually "Practical Example")
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-3.bas    # Third code block (usually "WOW Moment" or variations)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Single Code Block (some lessons)
When a lesson contains exactly one code block, it's named `main.bas`:
```
week-N/lesson-NN/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.bas         # Complete program
```

**Examples of single-block lessons:**
- Lesson 18 (Smooth Scrolling) - 1 complete program
- Lesson 48 (Scroll Runner Mini-Game) - 1 complete game
- Lesson 56 (Galactic Miner Mini-Game) - 1 complete game

## Lessons With Most Code Blocks

|--------|-------|--------|------|
| 24 | Battle Bots (Mini-Game) | 13 | Week finale mini-game |
| 32 | Circuit Run (Mini-Game) | 9 | Week finale mini-game |
| 15 | Random & Procedural | 7 | Multiple techniques |
| 21 | Reading Data | 7 | Multiple DATA examples |

## Usage

### Load Into VICE Emulator
```bash
# Start VICE C64 emulator
x64

# Inside emulator:
LOAD "example-1.bas",8
RUN
```

### Load Into Real Hardware
1. Copy .bas files to C64 disk image using c1541 tool
2. Insert disk in 1541 drive
3. `LOAD "filename",8` on C64
4. `RUN`

### Browse & Study
Each `.bas` file can be opened in any text editor to study the code structure and learn C64 BASIC V2 patterns.

## Validation Notes

All code samples were extracted from lessons that passed validation:
- No ENDIF blocks (doesn't exist in C64 BASIC V2)
- No WHILE/WEND loops (doesn't exist in C64 BASIC V2)
- No RANDOMIZE command (use `X=RND(-TI)` instead)
- No label syntax (use line numbers)
- All commands verified against C64 BASIC V2 reference

See `/docs/validation/c64-basic-final-report.md` for complete validation details.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Code samples extracted and organized
2. üìù Build pattern library from validated code
3. üìù Generate Quick Reference guides
4. üìù Create downloadable .d64 disk images per week
5. üìù Add README files to each week directory
