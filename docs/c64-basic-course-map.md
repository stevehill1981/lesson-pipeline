## Validation Notes

- Lessons 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 are mini-games (integration lessons)
- Each mini-game combines concepts from previous 7 lessons
- 20-40 line WOW moment programs expected
- No indentation in C64 BASIC V2 code
- Must validate: PRINT, POKE, PEEK, FOR/NEXT, IF/THEN, AND/OR, READ/DATA, GOSUB/RETURN, SYS
